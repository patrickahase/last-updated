    <!-- Well I guess there goes my schedule - had my birthday and got sick :( -->
    <!-- Definitely also put off by the fact I jumped straight into building tools - this project is also supposed to be about fun, so I'll probably push the current gradient generator to the side for the moment -->
    <!-- Let's do something relatively light and build a div that looks like the ff7 ui -->
    <!-- Start with building the background gradient then maybe work on borders? -->
    <!-- Be cool to have custom pointer cursor too but let's see how we go -->
    <!-- This is supposed to be layered but i think i'll just comment out the previous strain so I can come back to it -->

    <!-- Ok didn't get as far as I wanted - thanks to trigonometry basically and other distractions - but I'm happy with it for today -->
    <!-- I got the function to generate the angle from top right corner to bottom left -->
    <!-- It now needs to regenerate on resize as well as calculate the colour stops - probably just some more maths, but basically because it's skewed it won't be the same offset on each side -->
    <!-- Found someone had done one of those code pen UI recreations of ff7 but it's more fun trying to guess from a reference -->
