    <!-- I guess today I'm going to build on yesterdays animations by swapping the css gradients out with some svgs, should be easy enough I think -->
    <!-- I'd like to maybe make a tiling thing that will let me do the kind of diagonal stripe thing -->
    <!-- I'd also like to try my hand at some generative ascii funstions that might recreate the same with just text but that's a whole other thing to work through -->
    <!-- If I get time beyond this I'll make an effort to see how much I can push the animation itself, shifting speeds/directions maybe - like the source video -->
    <!-- I finished writing this comment block at 3:32pm -->
    <!-- I like having the generative div code here in line so I can keep track -->

    <!-- Well didn't get that far but it's only been 25 mins -->
    <!-- I need more time to think on how to approach this thing I'm doing though so calling it for today -->
    <!-- Basically it's super clunky to have to create the svgs in js, would love to do something like reacts functional rendering but not sure how -->
    <!-- I wonder if there's some sort of copy div function, perhaps that could work -->
    <!-- I define the seed div in html and then the js for loop instead of creating divs just copys that one and readjusts values? -->
    <!-- definitely an idea to follow up on -->
    <!-- The other approach would be like the blog i found - write a custom svg creation function, it could be viable but maybe not the thing I need for this project -->
    <!-- Saying that it seems like I want to write a library at some point considering all the stuff I'm doing with css and svgs, could save a lot of time -->
