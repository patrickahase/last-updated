    <!-- I know I need to layer it, I'm hoping I might get the effect I'm after using ::after - not sure if it really makes the source more human readible or just keep the code contained to css -->

    <!-- Well that didn't get too far, spent a long while trying to get ::before and ::after working but they didn't end up stacking in the way i'd hoped -->
    <!-- Then decided doing something like this might be easier if I just used svg, not sure though - i've started and run into the usual responsiveness issue with svg -->
    <!-- it really feels like this should be a little easier, I guess the expectation is to just use an image file -->
    <!-- maybe i could use an svg as reference in url tag instead of an image, just the gradient -->
    <!-- but at the end of the day how sucessful am i really going to be at "fully" recreating the style, maybe i'll give up and look at someone elses attempt at it tomorrow -->
    <!-- don't feel like I've learned nothing but i'm still on the lookout for a good method of doing these kind of generative complex css styling -->
