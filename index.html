    <!-- Ok so here's my first update - i'll put more of a general overview in my git readme but in regards to today lets start here -->
    <!-- Beyond the general set-up i'm going to try and define the banner size, then if I have time/cbf i'll start working on my gradient idea -->
    <!-- The gradient idea is to set up a text character gradient that works in steps so each letter is a single colour along the gradient -->
    <!-- This one is quite inspired by caves of qud, hopefully i can write it into a function -->
    <!-- To me seems to be two ways to go about this, either by stepping the gradient or breaking text into characters, but the second will destory view source readability so I guess we'll generate overly complex gradients -->
    <!-- I finished writing this comment block at 3:04pm -->

    <!-- took a break at 4:48pm -->
    <!-- tried to come back at 5:51pm but wasn't feeling it so here's where I'm leaving it today -->
    <!-- feel good about some of the base set up but didn't quite get there -->
    <!-- I was able to get the linear gradient function kind of working but it's still a little janky -->
    <!-- It's working from some predetermined rgb objects, I need to refactor to make it smooth, I guess the real question has been one of interfaces,
    where do I want to do the work of defining the gradient and how can I make that easiest? do I used it as something like a filter (by looking for all tagged
    with a class and then applying it to their existing css defined gradients) or do I make it as something determined at the input of the function, more flexible
    but certainly more annoying to scale -->
    <!-- thinking it through it comes down to what language do I want to be writing, html or css? probably css for something like this tbh, that's where I'm used
    to applying styling so that's where I'll keep it -->
