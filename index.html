    <!-- Ok it's been longer between than I'd hoped but I've been pooling all my time into room2 -->
    <!-- Have definitely worked through a few things there, tldr afters are VERY useful in making more complex shapes as well as svgs - both maintain a fairly good amount of source readability too which is a definite bonus -->
    <!-- I need to do more of the silly stuff here I think - tool making is important but maybe that shouldn't take precedent rn -->
    <!-- Sooo I'm going to create a scrolling 3D effect on the bg like the one here: https://youtu.be/OGDtViPngi8?t=67 -->
    <!-- Going to try my dynamic generated divs from room2s volume wrapper and then offset their animations -->
    <!-- But maybe a good goal for today would be to just hand code a simple version before scaling -->
    <!-- I finished writing this comment block at 3:22pm -->
    <!-- I like having the generative div code here in line so I can keep track -->

    <!-- next step is generating each of the 4 'sides' in more detail but i'm into the kind of janky motion that it's arrived at -->
    <!-- I do wonder if dynamically setting the animation length in the script i have would be useful alongside the delay setting -->
