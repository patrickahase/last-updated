    <!-- It's been a bit of a time for me the last couple of days but maybe good to do some quick work on this -->
    <!-- I'll just keep going from where I left off -->
    <!-- I want to ease the gradient somewhat - i think it's a little too sharp - and then I'll maybe have a got at the border -->
    <!-- I think the border issue will help me with room2 - I'd like to avoid too many unecessary divs but let's see what will get us there and I do suspect layering of seperate divs will be the thing -->
    <!-- for the gradient I'd like to try placing the origin point further NE of the corner, but to do that and retain the destination angle means i'll need to calculate the aspect ratio -->
    <!-- It may not be what i want though, perhaps a blur filter might be a hacky work around instead -->
    <!-- failing that overlaying gradients is a possibility, esp if I already have multiple divs going on -->
